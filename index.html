<h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
<h4><i>Last modified on August 9, 2022</i></h4>

By accessing or using our products and services ("Services" or “MTM App”), which are provided by Pironi Ltd (“MTM”), you are agreeing to these terms (“Terms”). Please read them carefully. These Terms are effective beginning when you first download, install, access, or use the Services. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES. 
<br></br>
These terms govern your use of the MTM App, including its features, apps, services, technologies, and software we offer, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply.  
<br></br>
<br></br>
ELIGIBILITY<br></br>
You must be at least 18 years old to use the Services. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) your registration and your use of the Services is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organisation, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.
<br></br>
<br></br>
USING OUR SERVICES<br></br>
You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.
<br></br>
Don't misuse our Services. For example, don't interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.
<br></br>
Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don't remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.
<br></br>
In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.
<br></br>
Our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.
<br></br>
<br></br>
YOUR MTM APP ACCOUNT<br></br>
You need to create an MTM App account in order to use our Services. To create your MTM App account, you need to provide some information to us. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. To protect your MTM App account, keep your password confidential. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your MTM App account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your MTM App account. Try not to reuse your MTM App account password on third-party applications. 
<br></br>
<br></br>
GENERAL PAYMENT TERMS<br></br>
Using the Services may require you to pay fees. All fees, except as expressly provided by applicable law, are non-refundable. 
<br></br>
MTM reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. MTM may change the price of any feature of the Service; if this occurs, MTM will provide you advance notice of the changes before they apply. MTM, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of MTM’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.
<br></br>
You authorize MTM and its third party payment processors to charge all sums for the Services as described in these Terms, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, MTM or its third party payment processors may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.
<br></br>
The Services may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription Service”). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorise MTM or its third party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period (e.g., monthly billing periods will be billed on the same day each month). The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. MTM or its third party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by <a href="mailto:paolo.pironi@gmail.com">contacting us</a>.
<br></br>
Delinquent Accounts: MTM may suspend or terminate access to the Services, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees.
<br></br>
<br></br>
PRIVACY PROTECTION<br></br>

<br></br>

THIRD PARTY TERMS<br></br>
MTM may provide tools through the Services that enable you to export information, including user content, to third party services, including through features that allow you to link your MTM App account with an account on the third party service. By using one of these tools, you agree that MTM may transfer that information to the applicable third party service. Third party services are not under MTM’s control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, MTM is not responsible for any third party service’s use of your exported information. The Services may also contain links to third party websites. Linked websites are not under MTM’s control, and MTM is not responsible for their content.

We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service. You should look at the terms regularly. We'll post modifications to these terms on this page.

If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of the Service.
<br></br>
If you violate any provision of these Terms, your authorization to access the Services and these Terms automatically terminate.
